# The Lie That Someone Knows

This repository contains material related to *The Lie That Someone Knows: On conspiracy, certainty, and exhaustion* by M. J. Stokknes.

This work is not an exposé.
It does not argue that conspiracy theories are true or false.
It examines why conspiracy thinking becomes psychologically necessary under modern conditions.

The core claim is simple:

> Conspiracy thinking is not madness.  
> It is a response to systems that demand endurance without offering agency.
